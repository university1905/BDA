actual rates increased unresolved Autism spectrum disorder video Autism highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder first appears infancy childhood generally follows steady course without remission People autism may severely impaired respects normal even superior others Overt symptoms gradually begin age six months become established age two three years tend continue adulthood although often muted form distinguished single symptom characteristic triad symptoms impairments social interaction impairments communication restricted interests repetitive behavior aspects atypical eating also common essential diagnosis Autism 's individual symptoms occur general population appear associate highly without sharp line separating pathologically severe common traits ===Social development=== Social deficits distinguish autism related autism spectrum disorders ASD see Classification developmental disorders People autism social impairments often lack intuition others many people take granted Noted autistic Temple Grandin described inability understand social communication neurotypicals people normal neural development leaving feeling `` like anthropologist Mars '' Unusual social development becomes apparent early childhood Autistic infants show less attention social stimuli smile look others less often respond less name Autistic toddlers differ strikingly social norms example less eye contact turn-taking ability use simple movements express pointing things Three- five-year-old children autism less likely exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate respond emotions communicate nonverbally take turns others However form attachments primary caregivers children autism display moderately less attachment security neurotypical children although difference disappears children higher mental development less severe ASD Older children adults ASD perform worse tests face emotion recognition although may partly due lower ability define person 's emotions Children high-functioning autism suffer intense frequent loneliness compared non-autistic peers despite common belief children autism prefer alone Making maintaining friendships often proves difficult autism quality friendships number friends predicts lonely feel Functional friendships resulting invitations parties may affect quality life deeply many anecdotal reports systematic studies aggression violence individuals ASD limited data suggest children intellectual disability autism associated aggression destruction property tantrums ===Communication=== third half individuals autism

Functional connectivity studies found hypo- hyper-connectivity brains people autism Hypo-connectivity seems dominate especially interhemispheric cortico-cortical functional connectivity ===Neuropsychology=== Two major categories cognitive theories proposed links autistic brains behavior first category focuses deficits social cognition Simon Baron-Cohen 's empathizing–systemizing theory postulates autistic individuals systemize—that develop internal rules operation handle events inside brain—but less effective empathizing handling events generated agents extension extreme male brain theory hypothesizes autism extreme case male brain defined psychometrically individuals systemizing better empathizing theories somewhat related Baron-Cohen 's earlier theory mind approach hypothesizes autistic behavior arises inability ascribe mental states oneself others theory mind hypothesis supported atypical responses children autism Sally–Anne test reasoning others motivations mirror neuron system theory autism described `` Pathophysiology '' maps well hypothesis However studies found evidence impairment autistic individuals ability understand people 's basic intentions goals instead data suggests impairments found understanding complex social emotions considering others viewpoints second category focuses nonsocial general processing executive functions working memory planning inhibition review Kenworthy states `` claim executive dysfunction causal factor autism controversial '' however `` clear executive dysfunction plays role social cognitive deficits observed individuals autism '' Tests core executive processes eye movement tasks indicate improvement late childhood adolescence performance never reaches typical adult levels strength theory predicting stereotyped behavior narrow interests two weaknesses executive function hard measure executive function deficits found young children autism Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes limited ability see big picture underlies central disturbance autism One strength theory predicting special talents peaks performance autistic people related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses superiority locally oriented perceptual operations autistic individuals theories map well underconnectivity theory autism Neither category satisfactory social cognition theories poorly address autism 's rigid repetitive behaviors nonsocial theories difficulty explaining social impairment communication difficulties combined theory based multiple deficits may prove useful Diagnosis based behavior cause mechanism DSM-5 autism characterized persistent deficits social communication interaction across multiple contexts well restricted repetitive patterns behavior interests

total proportion electromagnetic energy reflected values differ significantly common source confusion detailed studies directional reflectance properties astronomical bodies often expressed terms five Hapke parameters semi-empirically describe variation albedo phase angle including characterization opposition effect regolith surfaces correlation astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude diameter astronomical albedo diameter kilometers absolute magnitude ===Illumination=== Although albedo–temperature effect best known colder whiter regions Earth maximum albedo actually found tropics year-round illumination greater maximum additionally northern hemisphere varying three twelve degrees north minima found subtropical regions northern southern hemispheres beyond albedo increases without respect illumination ===Insolation effects === intensity albedo temperature effects depend amount albedo level local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas arctic antarctic regions cold due low insolation areas Sahara Desert also relatively high albedo hotter due high insolation Tropical sub-tropical rainforest areas low albedo much hotter temperate forest counterparts lower insolation insolation plays big role heating cooling effects albedo high insolation areas like tropics tend show pronounced fluctuation local temperature local albedo changes Arctic regions notably release heat back space absorb effectively cooling Earth concern since arctic ice snow melting higher rates due higher temperatures creating regions arctic notably darker water ground darker color reflects less heat back space feedback loop results reduced albedo effect ===Climate weather=== Albedo affects climate determining much radiation planet absorbs uneven heating Earth albedo variations land ice ocean surfaces drive weather ===Albedo–temperature feedback=== area 's albedo changes due snowfall snow–temperature feedback results layer snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading local cooling principle outside temperature change affects area e.g warm air mass raised albedo lower temperature would maintain current snow invite snowfall deepening snow–temperature feedback However local weather dynamic due change seasons eventually warm air masses direct angle sunlight higher insolation cause melting melted area reveals surfaces lower albedo grass soil effect reversed darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures induces melting thus reducing albedo resulting still heating ===Snow=== Snow albedo highly variable ranging high 0.9 freshly fallen snow 0.4 melting snow low 0.2 dirty snow Antarctica average little 0.8 marginally snow-covered area warms snow tends melt lowering albedo hence leading snowmelt radiation absorbed snowpack ice–albedo positive feedback Cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo glaciers ice sheets Hence small errors albedo lead large errors energy estimates important measure albedo snow-covered areas remote sensing techniques rather applying single value broad regions ===Small-scale effects=== Albedo works smaller scale sunlight dark clothes
