court superior court court limited jurisdiction appellate court part superior court party file appeal called appellant plaintiff error petitioner pursuer party side called appellee appeal brought respondent example suppose trial judge found plaintiff ordered defendant pay defendant file appeal arguing pay money plaintiff might file arguing defendant pay instead appellant party lost part claim lower court decision appealing higher court case reconsidered usually done basis lower court judge erred application law may also possible appeal basis court misconduct finding fact entirely unreasonable make evidence appellant new case either plaintiff claimant defendant intervenor respondent appellee lower case depending losing party winning party lower court however respondent unusual case appellant victor court still appeal appellee party appeal lower court judgment favor appellee required respond petition oral argument legal brief appellant general appellee take procedural

obtain leave appeal situation either lower court court may discretion grant refuse appellant demand appeal lower court decision supreme court review case available court exercise discretion grant writ

contempt court appealed immediately although case may otherwise fully disposed two distinct form appellate review direct collateral example criminal defendant may convicted state court lose direct appeal higher state appellate court unsuccessful mount collateral action filing writ habeas corpus federal court generally speaking direct appeal statute afford defendant opportunity challenge merit judgment allege error law fact collateral review hand provides independent civil inquiry validity conviction sentence generally limited challenge constitutional jurisdictional fundamental violation occurred trial graham borgen cir slip op citation omitted common law court appellate review lower court decision may also obtained filing petition review prerogative writ certain case corresponding right writ pure continental civil law legal system though mixed system quebec recognize prerogative writ exhausting first appeal right defendant usually petition highest state court review decision appeal known direct appeal highest state court generally known supreme court exercise discretion whether review case direct appeal prisoner challenge ground conviction based error occurred trial stage adjudicative process appellant claim must usually preserved trial mean defendant object error occurred trial constitutional claim great magnitude appellate court might lenient review claim even

constitutional violation clearly exists clearly deprived defendant fair trial subject harmless error analysis state failed demonstrate harmlessness alleged constitutional violation beyond reasonable doubt post conviction relief collateral state relief process similar federal relief appellant petition court correct alleged fundamental error corrected direct review typical claim might include ineffective assistance counsel actual innocence based new evidence proceeding normally separate direct appeal however state allow collateral relief sought direct appeal direct appeal conviction considered final appeal post conviction court proceeds direct appeal go intermediate appellate court followed highest court petition granted appellant could released incarceration sentence could modified new trial could ordered notice appeal form document many case required begin appeal form completed appellant appellant legal representative nature form vary greatly country country court

procedure party used filing appeal dismisses appeal without considering merit effect affirming judgment would happen example appellant waited long appellate court rule file appeal generally trial appellate court consideration record evidence presented trial court trial court proceeding appeal way new evidence usually considered appeal rare instance example material evidence unavailable party significant reason prosecutorial misconduct system appellate court consider written decision lower court together written evidence court relevant appeal system appellate court normally consider record
